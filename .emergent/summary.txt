The project, EduForge AI, started as an AI-powered educational content generator, quickly pivoting from Streamlit to a React frontend with FastAPI backend and MongoDB. Initial development focused on LLM-driven content (objectives, video scripts, quizzes, flashcards) and video creation using gTTS and MoviePy, with OpenSora integration deferred due to complexity.

A significant re-specification occurred in Chat 94, introducing Groq API key rotation, detailed learning style adaptation, a stateful chatbot, and high test coverage. The AI built out new backend services for Groq, video, and chatbot functionalities, alongside a new React UI. Subsequent work involved fixing several bugs, including a frontend  import error and backend JSON parsing/MoviePy issues.

The most recent user feedback (Chat 154) presented a critical set of new requirements and contradictions: explicitly removing learning style options, demanding user-centric video scripts, robust quiz/flashcard content, improved chatbot visibility, and full UI responsiveness. The AI is currently addressing these latest fixes, mainly focusing on content generation logic in the backend and comprehensive UI/UX adjustments in the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The EduForge AI application is an AI-powered platform for generating educational content.
**Core Features:**
1.  **Backend (FastAPI)**: Processes ,  (initially, then removed),  (initially, then removed). Utilizes Groq LLM to output structured JSON: . Converts video scripts into audio narration (gTTS/ElevenLabs) and generates simple visuals/slides (MoviePy for enhanced video generation). Exposes , , , and a stateful chatbot endpoint. Includes Groq API key rotation (4 keys, 20 requests/key, retry on failure) and per-session chatbot memory.
2.  **Frontend (React)**: Features an input form, tabbed output sections (Learning Objectives, Video Script, Quiz, Flashcards, UI Suggestions). Displays 5-7 detailed learning objectives. Video scripts must be user-friendly, explaining the topic without developer instructions. Quiz section needs 5-7 topic-related questions with hints/explanations, proper scoring, and a retest option. Flashcards should be topic-related Q/A with key-concept summaries. A floating chatbot must be clearly visible and functional. The UI must be fully responsive across total width and height.
3.  **Technical Requirements**: Pytest with 95% coverage, modular, production-ready code.

**Key Files and Importance/Changes:**

-   : The core FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints, orchestrates services, and handles request/response flow.
    -   **Changes**: Evolved from basic content/video generation to include enhanced logic for Groq, video, and chatbot services. Recent changes address JSON parsing, MoviePy API compatibility, and are currently being modified to adapt to the removal of learning style selection.
-   : Configuration management.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes environment-specific settings, particularly the Groq API key rotation logic.
    -   **Changes**: Introduced to manage multiple Groq API keys and their rotation.
-   : Pydantic data models.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures data validation and consistent structure for API requests and responses.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to incorporate  in the output JSON and resolved Pydantic import issues.
-   : Groq LLM integration.
    -   **Importance**: Manages calls to the Groq API, applying prompt engineering for content generation and handling API key rotation.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented key rotation. Currently being updated to generate user-friendly video scripts (without developer instructions) and high-quality, topic-related quiz questions and flashcard content. Modifications are also being made to remove reliance on learning style parameters.
-   : Video generation logic.
    -   **Importance**: Handles Text-to-Speech (gTTS), generates visual slides (using PIL/MoviePy), and compiles the final MP4 video.
    -   **Changes**: Initially provided basic slideshow functionality. Later enhanced for AI-generated scene descriptions, improved resolution (1080p), frame rate (30fps), dynamic backgrounds, and typography. Fixed MoviePy import and  method issues. Most recently, updated to strip developer scene markers from the final video script.
-   : Chatbot backend logic.
    -   **Importance**: Implements the conversational AI, likely using LangChain, and maintains per-session memory.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to introduce the chatbot feature.
-   : Main React application component.
    -   **Importance**: Renders the primary user interface, manages state, handles user input, and orchestrates calls to backend APIs.
    -   **Changes**: Initialized for the form and tabbed display. Enhanced to include interactive quizzes, flip-card flashcards, loading states, and embedded video. Integrated the  component. Fixed a critical  icon import error. Currently undergoing significant updates to remove learning style selection, ensure full UI responsiveness, and address chatbot visibility.
-   : Chatbot UI component.
    -   **Importance**: Provides the interactive floating chatbot interface on the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Created for the chatbot feature. It is currently being adjusted to resolve visibility issues, such as being obscured by other UI elements.
-   : Open-Sora repository clone.
    -   **Importance**: Represents the user's repeated explicit request for OpenSora video integration.
    -   **Changes**: The AI cloned the repository but decided against full integration due to environmental complexity, opting for an enhanced MoviePy-based solution instead. The user, however, has reiterated the request for OpenSora in Chat 94.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full OpenSora integration for AI-generated video content (user explicitly requested, AI has consistently deferred).
-   Achieving 95% test coverage (currently at 74%).
-   Implementing a retest option for incorrect quiz answers.
-   Final verification of chatbot UI visibility and re-open functionality after recent fixes.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing critical issues and new feature requirements outlined in Chat Message 154, focusing on improving content quality, refining video script generation, and enhancing the frontend user experience.

On the backend, in , the LLM prompting is being adjusted to:
1.  Generate video scripts that are user-friendly, providing proper explanations of topics rather than developer-focused scene instructions.
2.  Produce high-quality, topic-related quiz questions with hints and explanations, and meaningful, non-dummy flashcard content.
Additionally,  is being updated to ensure that developer-specific scene markers are removed from the script before it's used for video narration and visuals.

On the frontend, significant modifications are underway in  and :
1.  The UI for selecting 'visual', 'auditory', 'reading/writing', and 'kinesthetic' learning styles is being removed from , as the user indicated these options are no longer required and produced similar outputs. This is a direct contradiction of previous requirements.
2.  The application's UI is being adjusted for full responsiveness across all screen sizes, ensuring content is not confined to the middle portion of the display.
3.  The  component and its integration are being revised to ensure the chatbot button is clearly visible and functional, not being blocked by other elements like the Emergent logo, and that the chat content is accessible.

A lint error () was noted during the  update, which the AI proceeded to address while continuing with other  and  fixes. The immediate next action is to thoroughly test the entire application to validate these latest fixes.

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly test the complete application to ensure all recent fixes for content generation, chatbot, responsiveness, and learning style removal are working as expected.
